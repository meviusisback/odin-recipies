    <p>Lasagne is a celebrated Italian baked pasta dish, renowned for its comforting layers and rich, savory flavors. Originating from the Emilia-Romagna region—particularly Bologna—lasagne is a symbol of Italian culinary tradition and is often enjoyed during Sunday lunches and festive gatherings</p>
    <p>A classic lasagne consists of multiple layers of flat pasta sheets alternated with hearty fillings. The most traditional version, Lasagne alla Bolognese, features green spinach egg pasta, a slow-cooked ragù made from ground beef, pork, pancetta, carrots, celery, onions, tomato purée, and red wine, as well as a creamy béchamel (white sauce) and generous amounts of grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese</p>
