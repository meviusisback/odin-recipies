    <p>Pizza is an iconic Italian dish, most famously represented by the Neapolitan style, which is celebrated for its simplicity, balance, and use of high-quality ingredients. The foundation of a traditional Neapolitan pizza is a soft, elastic dough made from just four ingredients: type 0 or 00 wheat flour, water, salt, and yeastâ€”no oil or fats are added to the dough</p>
    <p>The dough is kneaded and left to rise for several hours, resulting in a light, airy crust with a characteristic chewy texture and a slightly charred, blistered edge after baking</p>
